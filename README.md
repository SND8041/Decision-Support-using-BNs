This project creates a web app. The web app is able to entertain diverse sets of users. Each user is given customized interface to interact with the app. The purpose of the 
app is to create oil spill scenario and decides which oil recovery method (e.g., in-situ burning, MNA, mechanical recovery, use of certain chemicals) suits best in the given
scenario. The app provides 5-year projection of the impact of oil spill on social, environmental, and economic aspects of the region that faces a spill. All calculations are 
done using a Bayesian network model.
